# DeFi Yield Manager Project
## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive solution for managing decentralized finance (DeFi) yield via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, along with a Node.js-based scheduler for automating tasks such as liquidity adjustments based on market conditions.

## Prerequisites
Node.js (version 12.x or higher)
npm (typically included with Node.js)
Ethereum wallet with Ether (for deploying contracts and handling transactions)
Remix IDE for compiling and deploying Ethereum smart contracts

## Project Setup
### Smart Contracts
Contracts Overview
DepositRouter: Manages initial deposits and token swaps.
PositionManager: Handles liquidity positions, minting of NFTs representing positions, yield distribution, and adjustments.
WithdrawalRouter: Manages the withdrawal process, calculating the current value of NFT-based deposits.
### Deployment Sequence
Compile Contracts in Remix IDE:
Open Remix IDE and create a new workspace.
Upload the smart contract files: DepositRouter.sol, PositionManager.sol, WithdrawalRouter.sol.
Compile each contract using the Solidity compiler (version specified in the contract, e.g., ^0.8.0).
### Deploy Contracts:
Deploy PositionManager first, as the address of this contract is required in DepositRouter and WithdrawalRouter.
Deploy DepositRouter, providing it the address of PositionManager and the addresses of the tokens to be used (TokenA, TokenB).
Deploy WithdrawalRouter, providing it the address of PositionManager.

## Node.js Scheduler
### Setup
1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
```
2. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Environment Configuration:
Copy the .env.example file to a new file named .env.
Fill in the environment variables in .env with appropriate values (Infura project ID, private key, contract addresses).

### Running the Scheduler
To start the scheduler, run:
```bash
node scheduler.js
```
This scheduler will execute predefined tasks on a regular basis, such as adjusting liquidity based on current market conditions.
